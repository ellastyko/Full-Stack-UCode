    <h2 id='first'>What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>Superhero is <b>a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do 
        them in a way that a normal person couldn’t.</b> So in order to be a superhero, 
        you need a power that is more exceptional <br> any power a normal human being 
        could possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. 
        Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. 
        For instance, <br>a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police 
        story or detective story or human-interest story. 
        But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, 
        it becomes <i>superhero story.</i> <br>If the good guy is doing something that a 
        normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes 
        a superhero.</p>
