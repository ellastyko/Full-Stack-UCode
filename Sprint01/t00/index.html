        Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and 
        writer-artist Steve Ditko. He first appeared in the anthology comic book 
        Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He appears in 
        American comic books published by Marvel Comics, as well as in a number of movies, 
        television shows, and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe. In the stories, 
        Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben 
        in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee 
        and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues, 
        and accompanied him with many supporting characters, such as J. Jonah Jameson, Harry 
        Osborn, Max Modell, romantic interests Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson, and foes such 
        as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin and Venom. His origin story has him acquiring 
        spider-related abilities after a bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging 
        to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his "spider-sense.
        " He then builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webbing
        of his own design.

        When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were 
        usually relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke 
        ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens behind Spider-Man's 
        secret identity and with whose "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" 
        young readers could relate.[9] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike 
        previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain 
        America and Batman; he thus had to learn for himself that "with great power there must also 
        come great responsibility"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first 
        Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, the late Uncle Ben Parker.

        Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting 
        of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the years, the Peter Parker character developed 
        from a shy, nerdy New York City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, 
        to married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance photographer. 
        In the 2010s, he joins the Avengers. Spider-Man's nemesis Doctor Octopus also took on the 
        identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears 
        die.[10] Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including 
        Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; 
        Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate 
        universe; and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes 
        up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death. Miles is later 
        brought into mainstream continuity, where he sometimes works alongside Peter.
